# Topics and Subscriptions Guidelines

> **Note:** This rule complements `pubsub.mdc` with specific patterns for resource name handling and CRUD operations.

## Resource Name Handling

### Topic and Subscription IDs
- **Full Resource Names**: GCP Pub/Sub uses full resource names like `projects/{project-id}/topics/{topic-id}` or `projects/{project-id}/subscriptions/{subscription-id}`
- **Topic/Subscription Names Only**: Sometimes code receives just the name part (e.g., `my-topic` instead of the full path)
- **Always Normalize**: When creating subscriptions or topics, check if the input is already a full resource name before prepending the project prefix

### Subscription ID Format Requirements
- **Valid Characters**: Subscription IDs can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
- **Invalid Characters**: Forward slashes (`/`) are NOT allowed in subscription IDs
- **Length Limits**: Subscription IDs must be between 3 and 255 characters
- **When Generating IDs**: Always extract the topic name (last segment after `/`) before using it in subscription ID generation

### Example: Creating Temporary Subscriptions

See implementation in `app.go:732-764` for `StartTopicMonitor` which demonstrates:
- Extracting topic name from full resource path
- Generating valid subscription ID (no slashes!) with format `ps-gui-mon-{short-topic}-{random}`

```go 755:764:app.go
	// Extract the actual topic name from the full resource path if necessary
	topicName := topicID
	if parts := strings.Split(topicID, "/"); len(parts) > 0 {
		topicName = parts[len(parts)-1]
	}

	shortTopic := topicName
	if len(shortTopic) > 20 {
		shortTopic = shortTopic[:20]
	}
	subID := fmt.Sprintf("ps-gui-mon-%s-%d", shortTopic, time.Now().UnixNano()%1000000)
```

## Resource Name Normalization Pattern

When working with GCP Pub/Sub resources, always handle both formats. See actual implementations:

**For Create Operations (extract short name first):**
- Topic creation: See `internal/pubsub/admin/topics.go:86-94` for normalization logic
- Subscription creation: See `internal/pubsub/admin/subscriptions.go:135-153` for normalization logic

**For Delete Operations (accept both formats):**
- Topic deletion: See `internal/pubsub/admin/topics.go:123-127` for normalization logic
- Subscription deletion: See `internal/pubsub/admin/subscriptions.go:189-192` for normalization logic

## CRUD Operation Patterns

### Creating Resources

**Topics:**
- Topics are immutable in GCP - only Create and Delete operations are supported
- Message retention duration can be set at creation time only
- Topic IDs must be valid: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores

**Subscriptions:**
- Full CRUD support: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Must specify a topic when creating
- Can update: ack deadline, retention duration, filter, dead letter policy, push config
- Use field masks when updating to only change specified fields

### Validating Resource IDs

**Note:** The codebase relies on GCP API validation for resource ID format. When generating subscription IDs programmatically (e.g., for temporary subscriptions), ensure:
- Only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores (NO slashes)
- Length between 3 and 255 characters
- Extract topic name from full resource path before using in subscription ID generation

See `app.go:755-764` for an example of extracting topic name and generating a valid subscription ID.

### Error Handling for CRUD Operations

Always provide user-friendly error messages with permission hints. See actual implementations:

**Topic Operations:**
- Create: See `internal/pubsub/admin/topics.go:115` for error message with permission hint
- Delete: See `internal/pubsub/admin/topics.go:135` for error handling

**Subscription Operations:**
- Create: See `internal/pubsub/admin/subscriptions.go:164-165` for topic existence check and `internal/pubsub/admin/subscriptions.go:181` for error message with permission hint
- Delete: See `internal/pubsub/admin/subscriptions.go:200` for error handling

## Topic-Subscription Relationships

### Querying Relationships

The codebase provides methods to query relationships between topics and subscriptions:

**Backend Methods (in `app.go`):**
- `GetTopicSubscriptions(topicID string)` - Returns all subscriptions subscribed to a topic
- `GetSubscriptionsUsingTopicAsDeadLetter(topicID string)` - Returns subscriptions that use a topic as their dead letter topic
- `GetDeadLetterTopicsForTopic(topicID string)` - Returns dead letter topics used by subscriptions subscribed to a topic

**Implementation Pattern:**
- All methods normalize topic IDs (handle both full path and short name)
- Methods filter client-side from full lists (no GCP API filtering available)
- Return empty arrays (not errors) when no relationships exist
- See `app.go:348-447` for implementation examples

**Frontend Usage:**
- These methods are exposed via Wails bindings
- Use in React components to display relationship tabs (e.g., "Subscriptions" and "Dead Letter" tabs in TopicDetails)
- Handle loading states and empty states appropriately
- See `frontend/src/components/TopicDetails.tsx` for example usage
